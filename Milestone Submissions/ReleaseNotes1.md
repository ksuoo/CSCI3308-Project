# Release Notes 11/15/2023

Lab 11: Worked on creating 4 test cases for basic functions of the website such as register and login. Also created a UAT plan for features that we will implement in the future and their criteria

Website: Have a functioning register and login page that stores a user's info a database and hashes their password. Created a directory on the navbar and added stylistic touches to the website with a 'logo' to replace Chef It Up text. Also made changes to directory structure and docker-compose.yaml file to make sure that the website can be viewed

Database: Created tables for users and recipes. Insert query for all of the recipes completed.
